[Teo](https://teodev.io) is a **declarative** HTTP server 
framework. It supports Node.js, Python and Rust. Teo transforms traditional 
CRUD development, aggregate & statistics API development and database migration 
into a single file with data model declarations. It increases development speed 
rapidly. Teo exposes ORM API, traditional route handlers and first-in-last-out 
middlewares for custom app logics. The route handlers are type-safe. Teo does
data validations through the interfaces and models declared in the schema. It
generates frontend clients from the schema for both auto-synthesized handlers
and user-defined handlers.

## Why Flutter client?

Actually in the version last year, Teo supports TypeScript/javaScript, Swift,
Kotlin, C# and Dart client. Due to the big overhaul and the introduction of the
namespace feature. The client generation code is not updated. This time, one of 
our user has requirement for this. We changed our plan and arranged 
this feature for him. 

We care about business values. Having frontend developers write less code, is 
able to decrease development time and debugging time. For full-stack 
developers, these are just benefits of money and living quality. For companies
and teams that choose and use Teo, this means lower cost and shorter 
development time.

Currently TypeScript/javaScript, and Dart/Flutter are supported. We never 
forgot clients of other languages. Flutter developers and teams build 
cross-platform products. We can help them more on reducing backend server
development time. I love to help great people success. If I was rich, I would
investigate a lot of great projects. It's a pity that I'm poor. I love to 
create great open source frameworks, softwares and tools to make each of us 
living better. However, there isn't any unemployment benefit in China, at
least, it's unavailable for me. What I can only do is creating great technical
solutions. To save a lot of cost for users and make their business success, is 
like investigating without any shares. This is what I'm happy about.

## Development plan

Currently we have an enterprise user and around 10 individual users. Our 
enterprise user want a feature which is generating the admin portal. We 
consider it quite makes sense. With this feature, developers don't need to 
write any code or write a little code to obtain an admin portal. It provides
visualization and interfaces for the server data. This feature is the next 
major task for us. We care our users and if you become our user, we takes your
requirement into consideration and discuss with you for the best 
implementation. We may update our plan and add features just for you.

Next we will do:
* Upgraded user session
* Upgrated permission validation
* Generating admin protal
* Upgrated Swift client for Apple Vision Pro
* Full-text search
* Data subscription (for chatting softwares, games and online bidding softwares)
* SQL JSON type and MongoDB nested interfaces

## Support us

It's been hard to create and maintain open source softwares. Hope you would 
click a star for us at [Github](https://github.com/teodevgroup/teo).

## Become our user

Wouldn't it be nice if you become our user, and we are always responding fast 
if there are bugs found and requirements come. You can determine what we build 
next just for you. Our service is great and it's totally free, most of the 
times better than paid ones. Join our [Discord](https://teodev.io/discord)
and we are available for you.

## Become our contributor

I'd like to have more people discuss together, and develop together. I want 
sponsorships and fundings. But it's ok if I don't have that. Growing users
and data are more important. If you could do anything to help, please contact
